# PRODIGY-INFOTECH COMPLETED THESE TASKS:

TASK 1:
Build a Temperature Conversion Program

Create a program that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales. The program should prompt the user to input a temperature value and the original unit of measurement. It should then convert the temperature to the other two units and display the converted values to the user. For example, if the user enters a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius, the program should convert it to Fahrenheit and Kelvin, and present the converted values as outputs.


TASK 2:
Create a Guessing Game

Build a program that generates a random number and challenges the user to guess it. The program should prompt the user to input their guess, compare it to the generated number, and provide feedback if the guess is too high or too low. It should continue until the user correctly guesses the number and then display the number of attempts it took to win the game.


TASK 3:
Implement a Simple Contact Management System

Develop a program that allows users to store and manage contact information. The program should provide options to add a new contact by entering their name, phone number, and email address. It should also allow users to view their contact list, edit existing contacts, and delete contacts if needed. The program should store the contacts in memory or in a file for persistent storage.


TASK 4:
Implement a Sudoku Solver

Create a program that solves Sudoku puzzles automatically. The program should take an input grid representing an unsolved Sudoku puzzle and use an algorithm to fill in the missing numbers.
It should use backtracking or other suitable techniques to explore possible solutions and find the correct arrangement of numbers for the puzzle. Once solved, the program should display the completed Sudoku grid.


TASK 5:
Web Scraping   

Create a program that extracts product information, such as names, prices, and ratings, from an online e-commerce website and stores the data in a structured format like a CSV file. 
You are free to choose the website you scrape from.
